After years of running WordPress, I've finally bit the bullet and moved to a
Static Site Generator, in my case: Hugo. After long deliberation, I decided not
to move most of the old content over. 

I registered palstra.com in 2000, and at that time, still built it by hand in
plain HTML, sometimes with help of some tooling. In 2004, I moved over to
Movable Type, and after some time, migrated to WordPress.
