When my father died in 2018, a few boxes of slides and negatives were left
behind in my parents house in Lelystad. After it was sold, it lingered in the
house of my sister's in-laws in Nieuwenhoorn, but that was sold too. And
after a large cleanup of the collection which moved to my sister's house,
I've decided to take this boxes home with me and bite the bullet on buying a
PlusTek OpticFilm scanner.

After telling the SilverFast for MacOS software that it's processing a
KodaChrome slide of film negative, sliding the resolution to 7200 DPI and
trying out my luck with some automatic corrections, the results are
surprisingly good. It will take me quite some time to go through all the
negatives (it's a large collection with not many previews) but I'm staying
positive about the process.

If it's not for my analogue or digital hoarding, it may end up in a large
family album, or just as a simple presentation to show my son Ryan (and also
my other new family members) all the Palstra family members he never got to
meet.
